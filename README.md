#h1 Canvas Calendar App

This is an App I made that logs Canvas assignments in a calendar interface. The app was programmed for react native, using the Expo Go interface for mobile testing. I stopped development on the app (Which was constructed in
the fall of my junior year of high school) because I realized I would need permissions from the school to get certain tokens for the authentication I would need, since Canvas LMS had removed its compatability
with Bearer tokens just before I began development.
